🏰 About The Project

GARDEN FIELD EDITOR is a Python-based text editor that replicates the functionality of GNU nano but is skinned to match the sleek, gunmetal-grey interface of Final Fantasy VIII.

Designed for SeeD candidates who need to edit config files in the field while maintaining immersion. It features a responsive "Junction" menu system, CRT scanline overlays, and the iconic high-contrast palette of Balamb Garden's terminals.

✨ Features

Gunblade Grey Aesthetic: A smooth gradient background (#1e2024 to #3a3e45) that mimics the PS1 menu shading.

Junction Menu System: The bottom command bar is laid out like the FF8 Battle Menu.

JUNCTION: Save File (^O)

SCAN: Open File (^R)

RETREAT: Exit Editor (^X)

CRT Scanlines: Subtle horizontal lines overlay the entire interface for that 1999 terminal feel.

Nano Keybindings: Fully supports standard nano shortcuts, so your muscle memory remains intact.

Dynamic Status: The header tracks filename and modification status (turning RED when unsaved).
